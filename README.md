<h1>YAK<sup>2</sup> (Yet Another K8S Kickstart)</h1>

Did we really need <b>Yet Another Kubernetes Kickstart (YAKK –> YAK2)</b> script to nearly automatically deploy a K8S cluster? Didn’t we already have enough alternatives (you can search on Google to find tons of examples) to setup a demo/lab/test/POC environment? Probably yes, nevertheless…

I created mine. It all started as self-practice to learn how to setup Kubernetes using <code>kubeadm</code>, then it evolved into something more structured and – in the end – I eventually decided to share it with anyone who may benefit from it.

The starting point was using a given Linux distro we – when we deal with VMware products – know very well: Photon OS, “a Linux based, open source, security-hardened, enterprise grade appliance operating system that is purpose built for Cloud and Edge applications” (the description was promising).
